                    <p>
                        Matrix first opened in 2017; born from a dream and a need to paint yellow trucks. Our very own Doug worked for Waynes for over a decade. 
                        He always had a thing for classic cars but no room of his own to work on them, so he got to work on a creative solution. 
                        <br> 
                        <br>
                        
                        Step 1: Annoy Steven, Waynes owner at the time, into buying a classic 1972 Pontiac Firebird <br> 
                        Step 2: Use Waynes warehouse space to fix it up in his spare time. <br> 
                        Step 3: Repeat. <br> 
                        <br>
                        The plan worked and after 2 years of meticulous work, the Firebird was restored. After a few more restoration jobs, Steven and Doug had a realization: a hobby had turned into a business. <br> 
                        <br>
                        As more projects followed the original Firebird, Matrix moved to a small shop in Pelham. They started painting, outfitting, and maintaining the iconic Waynes and Chorus fleets.The team grew as Matrix restored badass muscle cars while also supporting corporate fleets.
                        Before long Doug, Nick, Justin, Chris, and Clyde had more work than the Pelham shop could support. <br>        
                        <br>
                        In September of 2019, the shop moved down the street to a new home. We like to think that our new Alabaster shop is the world headquarters for taking old and making it exceptionally cool. <br>  
                        <br>
                        Building and restoring performance vehicles is our passion. We live for all kinds of muscle cars, hot rods, trucks, modified, restored, rat rods, customs, old or new it doesn't matter. <br>
